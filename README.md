🎵 SpotiTanus – Optimized Spotify Player 🎵

🚀 The most advanced and complete Spotify player. Core features are already working, while some modules are still in progress.
👉 I’m still perfecting a few features and creating videos/screenshots to showcase the player. Because development takes a lot of time, your support is crucial! If you enjoy the project, you can buy me a coffee ☕ — once I reach my goal, I’ll publish the full source code.
